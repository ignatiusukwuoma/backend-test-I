## How to complete the task

1. Fork this repository into your own public repo.

2. Complete the project and commit your work. Make a screencast of how it works with the googlespread sheet and progam side-by-side. Please watch this sample video to see what your screencast should look like https://youtu.be/mwBqUUtBtlE

3. Send the URL of your own repository and the screencast to @kolawole.balogun on the Slack here bit.ly/dcs-slack.

## Show your working

If you choose to use build tools to compile your CSS and Javascript (such as SASS of Coffescript) please include the original files as well. You may update this README file outlining the details of what tools you have used.

## Clean code

This fictitious project is part of a larger plan to reuse templates for multiple properties. When authoring your CSS ensure that it is easy for another developer to find and change things such as fonts and colours.


## Good luck!

We look forward to seeing what you can do. Remember, although it is a test, there are no specific right or wrong answers that we are looking for - just do the job as best you can. Any questions - create an issue in the panel on the right (requires a Github account).
